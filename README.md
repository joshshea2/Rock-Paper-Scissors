# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Odin Project #2 - Rock, paper, scissors

Multiple days spent trying to figure this project out. Ended up restarting halfway through.
End result isn't exactly what the project asked for, but I'm happy with it nontheless.

Learning points:

- How to create a random result based off an array
- Placing if statements inside if statements
- the use of template literals
- proper use of const and let, as well as placement in correct scope
- How to create a loop

All in all this project was more difficult than I originally thought, but through trial and error, I finally completed it the first step. I have a new found respect for every little thing (at least what you think is little) that goes into what you do on a website, app, or game. Every little thing more than likely has quite a few lines of code to make it work. I mean look at what a simple game of rock paper scissors takes, and this is only played on the browser console.
